## 1.7 Bindings

### Variables (revisited)
---

- **name** on the left side
    - descriptive
    - meaningful
    - helps you re-read code
    - **cannot** be **keywords** (ex. `int`, `float`, etc.)
- **value** computed on the right side
    - could be any legal expression that returns a value
    - information is **stored** (binding)
    - can be updated through reassignment

---
### Binding example (swap)
---

All this might seem simple enough, but we need to be careful about the order in which things are done.  The following is **incorrect** swapping of two variables:  

```python
x = 1
y = 2
y = x
x = y
```

You might already be able to see that both variables in this example end up with the value `2`.  

*This* would be the correct method of swapping `x` and `y`, utilizing a third variable temporarily:  
```python
x = 1
y = 2
temp = y
y = x
x = temp
```

This `temp` variable allows us to reassign `x` to `y`'s initial value, `2`, after it has also been altered to `x`'s initial value of `1`.  I.e., the variables' values were successfully swapped here.

## 1.8 Strings

**Strings** are letters, special characters, spaces, digits...  They are enclosed in **quotation marks** *or* **single quotes**:  
`hi = "hello there"`  
`greeting = 'hello'`  

> Double quotes can be used in the case that we want to use an apostrophe somewhere in the string—this way, the Python interpreter doesn't mistake that apostrophe for the end of the string.  

Strings can be *concatenated*:  
```python
hi = 'hello there'
name = 'Eric'
greeting = hi + ' ' + name
```

> What we say when we talk about using the **addition operator** in this way is that it is *overloaded*.  The type of the argument object tells the operator how to proceed.  In this case we're seeing, the `string` type of the two objects is telling the addition operator to concatenate them.  

---
### Operations on strings
---

|  | input | output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **concatenation** | `'ab' + 'cd'` | `'abcd'` |
| **successive concatenation** | `3 * 'eric'` | `'ericericeric'` |
| the **length** | `len('eric')` | `4` |
| **indexing** | `'eric'[1]` | `'r'` |
| **slicing** | `'eric'[1:4]` | `'ric'` |
| ... | `'eric'[:3]` | `'eri'` |
| ... | `'eric'[1:]` | `'ric'` |
| ... | `'eric'[:]` | `'eric'` |



Strings are **non-scalar** objects.  We can get out pieces, if desired:  

> Indexing:  
- begins with index 0
- attempting to index beyond length-1 throws an error

> Slicing:
- extracts the sequence starting at first index and ending ***before*** the second index
- if no value before `:`, start at index 0
- if no value after `:`, end at length
- can create a ***copy*** with `[:]`

> Advanced slicing techniques:  
- assume `s` is a string
- we're going to take a slice of `s` from two indices `i` and `j`, denoted as `s[i:j]`
- we can optionally add a third parameter when slicing called the **step size**, which we'll denote with `k`, in the format `s[i:j:k]`
    - step size allows us, in the following examples, to get out every other character in `s` or every third character and so on...
```python
In [1]: s = 'Python is fun!'

In [2]: len(s)
Out [2]: 14

In [3]: s[1:12:2]
Out [3]: 'yhni u'

In [4]: s[2:12:3]
Out [4]: 'tnsu'

In [5]: s[::2]
Out [5]: 'Pto sfn'
```
> `in` operator:  
- a ***collection*** refers to a **string**, **list**, **tuple**, or **dictionary** (we'll cover lists, tuples, and dictionaries soon enough)
    - the `in` and `not in` operators are used to test *collection membership*
        - the expression `element in coll` evaluates to `True` if `element` **is** a member of the collection `coll`, and `False` otherwise
        - the expression `element not in coll` evaluates to `True` if `element` **is not** a member of the collection `coll`, and `False` otherwise
            - this is the **negation** of `element in coll`—the expression `element not in coll` is equivalent to `not (element in coll)`

---
---
## 1.9 Input/output

### Input/output: `print()`
---

- used to **output** stuff to the console
- `print` is a **keyword**

---
### Input/output: `input("")`
---

- prints whatever is in the quotes
- think of it as a prompt for the user to type something in and hit enter
- returns the entered sequence
    - we can bind that return value to a variable for reference

```python
text = input('Type something!')
print(5*text)
```

- `input` always **returns a string**, so we must be careful to **cast** if we are working with numbers:
```python
num = int(input('Type a number!'))
print(5*str(num))
```

## 1.10 IDEs


- painful to try to flesh out entire programs and systems with just a shell
    - **text-editor** used to manipulate files alone or it can be part of an **integrated development environment** (IDE)

- IDEs can include, but are not limited to:
    - text editor
        - used to enter, edit, and save programs
    - shell
        - place in which we can interact with and run our programs
        - standard methods to evaluate your programs from the editor or from stored files
    - integrated debuggers

## 1.11 Control flow

### Using control in loops
---

- simple branching programs just make choices, but path through code is still linear
- we sometimes want to reuse blocks of code an indeterminate number of times

---
### Control flow: `while` loops
---

```python
while <condition>:
    <expression>
    <expression>
    ...
```

- in the template example above, `condition` evaluates to a Boolean
    - if `condition` is `True`, do all the steps inside the `while` code block
    - check `<condition>` again
    - repeat until `<condition>` is `False`

---
### Control flow: `while` vs. `for` loops
---

```python
n = 0
while n < 5:
    print(n)
    n += 1
```

- the pattern exemplified above will run how you might expect, but we have to be really careful to consider **edge cases** when using `while` loops
    - what if we forgot to set `n = 0` before we run the code?
        - we're either going to get an error because `n` isn't bound to anything, or we might get some performance we don't expect if `n` had some unexpected value already
    - similarly, what if we forget to increment `n` in our `while` block?
        - our machine is then going to print out `0` until we force it to quit the program

- thankfully, we can use `for` loops in many places to keep things less complicated
- the syntax of `for` loops includes:
    - variable
    - the **keyword** `in` 
    - an expression

```python
for n in range(5):    # in simple terms, range(5) gives us a sequence of integers starting at 0 and ending before 5
    print(n)
```

---
### Control flow: `for` loops
---

```python
for <variable> in range(<some_num>):
    <expression>
    <expression>
    ...
```

- each time through the loop, `<variable>` takes a value
    - through each iteration of the loop, `<variable>` takes on some new value; whether we're incrementing, moving through a collection, etc.
    - when we break out of the loop is based on the conditions we define in the statement of the loop

---
### `range(start, stop, step)`
---

- `for` loop default values are `start=0` and `step=1`
    - `step` is an optional parameter
- loop continues through `stop - 1`

```python
mysum = 0
for i in range(7, 10):
    mysum += i
print(mysum)
```

```python
mysum = 0
for i in range(5, 11, 2):
    mysum += i
print(mysum)
```

---
### `break` statement
---

- if a `break` statement is run, it immediately exits whatever loop it is in
    - stops execution of the loop at that point, skipping any remaining expressions that might be in the code block
- in nested loops, it exits us only from the innermost loop in which it is placed

```python
mysum = 0
for i in range(5, 11, 2):
    mysum += i
    if mysum == 5:
        break
print(mysum)
```

- what happens in this code?
    - prints `5` as we break out of the loop before `i` is incremented by the `step` amount

---
### Contrasting `while` and `for` loops
---

> `for loops`  
> - **know** number of iterations
> - can **end early** via `break`
> - uses a **counter**
> - **can rewrite** a `for` loop using a `while` loop

> `while loops`  
> - **unbounded** or **indeterminate** number of iterations
> - can **end early** via `break`
> - *can* use a **counter**, but **must initialize** before loop and increment or alter it inside the loop
> - **may not be able to** rewrite a `while` loop using a `for` loop

In most code, we tend to use `for` loops when we know what we're going to do as a computation.  
We'll use `while` loops when there's going to be a condition that we can't predict that's going to allow us to break out of that loop.  
Both are the first versions of **iterative algorithms** that we've seen thus far.  

---
---
## 1.12 Iteration

- concept of **iteration** lets us considerably extend simple branching programs to be able to write programs of arbitrary complexity
    - start with a **test**
    - if test evaluates to `True`, then execute loop body once and go back to reevaluate the test
    - repeat until test evaluates to `False`, after which the code following the iteration statement is executed

---
### Iterative code
---

- branching structures (conditionals) let us jump to different pieces of code based on a test
    - programs are **constant time**
- looping structures (e.g., `while`) let us repeat pieces of code until a condition is satisfied
    - programs now take time that depends on values of variables, as well as the length of the program

---
---
## 1.13 Guess and check

Iterative algorithms have dramatically broadened the class of things that we can compute—we're able to do so much more than just simple arithmetic at this point.  
We can now repeat a sequence of steps multiple times based on some decision, which leads us right to new classes of algorithms.  
An example of these new classes of algorithms is **guess and check** methods.

---
### Guess and check
---
Recall our declarative definition of the square root of `x`.  
If we have a way to systematically generate guesses, we can use declarative knowledge (checking if `g*g = x`) to much greater effect.  We just need a good way to generate those guesses.  

This is, essentially, the basis of guess and check:
- come up with a way of systematically making guesses for the possible answer
- check the answer
- repeat process in an iterative algorithm
- stop when a solution that fits our definition has been found

We'll see that **loops** are a good way to accomplish our goals here.  

---
### Loop characteristics
---

- need a **loop variable**
    - initialized outside the loop
    - changes within the loop
    - test for termination depends on variable
- useful to think about a **decrementing function**
    - maps set of program variables into an integer
    - when loop is entered, value is non-negative
    - when value is `<= 0`, loop terminates
    - value is decreased every time through the loop

---
### What if we miss a condition?
---

- suppose we don't initialize the variable?
    - likely get a `NameError` or, worse yet, use an unexpected value to initiate the computation
- suppose we don't change the variable inside the loop?
    - will end up in an infinite loop, never reaching the terminating condition

---
### Guess and check summary
---

Definitely not the most efficient solution, nor is it one that will work in every case, but...
- you are able to **guess a value** for a solution
- you are able to **check if the solution is correct**
- keep guessing until solution is found or all values guessed
- this is an example of a set of algorithms/process called **exhaustive enumeration**
    - exhaust all possible options to use
    - can take a while to run, depending on how many options we have to go through

---
### Cleaner guess and check—cube roots
---

```python
cube = 8

# We can use for loop here as we know that cube root must be less than cube itself
for guess in range(cube+1):
    if guess**3 == cube:

        # Will only print something out if we work with a positive perfect cube
        print('Cube root of', cube, 'is', guess)
```

```python
cube = 8

# Find guess
for guess in range(abs(cube+1)):
    if guess**3 >= abs(cube):
        break

# Guess was greater than the absolute value of the cube
if guess**3 != abs(cube):
    print(cube, ' is not a perfect cube!')

else:
    if cube < 0:
        # Flip sign if cube was negative
        guess = -guess

    # Print guess as solution
    print('Cube root of', cube, 'is', guess)
```

---
### Exhaustive enumeration
---

- guess and check methods can work on problems with a finite number of possibilities
- good way to generate guesses in an organized manner
